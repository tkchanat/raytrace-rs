# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Rust Edition :crab:
This is a personal Rust learning project. Giving myself a little challenge to transform C/C++ code into Rust code while learning the fundamental knowledge of ray tracing. 

## Getting Started
I tried my best to comment all commits by its corresponding subsection title within the book. Sorry if I merged/skipped some programming practices. 
```shell
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```
